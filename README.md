# Python vCard Utility

A utility library for working with [the **Virtual Contact File** (abbreviated as _vCard_) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) and contact books in general. It is tested to work with Python 3.11 and above.

## Early Development

This code is a cleaner, more module implementation of code that has been included in a personal side project, so parts of it may be very experimental and buggy. If you notice anything amiss, please file an [Issue](../../issues). Pull Requests are also greatly appreciated, although I have no set schedule to approve anything at the moment, as I anticipate being the only one using this for a while.
